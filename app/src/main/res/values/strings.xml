It is located in the center of the campus with the library walk to its south, Thurgood Marshall College to its West and Earl Warren College to its East.\n\nThe library was simply called the "Central Library" until a renovation was completed in 1993. The library was rededicated as the University Library Building. It was renamed the Geisel Library Building in 1995.</string>
